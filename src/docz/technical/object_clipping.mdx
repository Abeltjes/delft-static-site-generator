# Chipped Away Corners

One of the main visual features the TUDelft static site has is the cropped edges on the visual display blocks.

## Available options

There are 4 main ways to implement the feature.

- css clip-path
- svg clipPath
- solid background colour and :before :after pseudo elements
- element injection

## Css Clipping 

Css clipping is not fully supported, but has a really good browser coverage. For the details please see the 
compatibility chart below:

[https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-clip-path](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-clip-path)

From the compatibility charts it turns out that most of the major browsers, except for IE/Edge supports the feature using
css polygon syntax.

```css
.clip-corners {
  clip-path: polygon(
    0% 50px,                 /* top left */
    50px 0%,                 /* top left */
    calc(100% - 50px) 0%,    /* top right */
    100% 50px,               /* top right */
    100% calc(100% - 50px),  /* bottom right */
    calc(100% - 50px) 100%,  /* bottom right */
    50px 100%,               /* bottom left */
    0 calc(100% - 50px)      /* bottom left */
  );
}
```

The external SVG reference version is supported only in Firefox, mainly because the non inline SVG images in browsers handled
a slightly different way than the inline ones where the id references can be used for referencing definitions inside the svg 
(elements in the defs tag). So that leaves the inline version, which means that the element needs to be printed into the 
output html. 

There are other issues with the SVG clip paths, more on that later on in the SVG clip path section.

In IE/Edge Svg Clip paths are fully supported down to IE9.
